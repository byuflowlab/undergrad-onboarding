### Headers
Although not necessary, you'll probably want to get in the habit of putting commented headers in your coding files with information such as who the author is (you), when it was written, what the file does, and any major updates after initial publication.

### Style Guide
We follow the Julia language [Style Guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/index.html). Read through it. You won't understand a lot of it at this point, but keep referring back to make sure you're coding in the accepted style (this makes it much easier for people to read your code).

### The basics
The [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/) page for Julia has more than you'll need to get started.  Learn how to do basic math such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, etc.

Create a new .jl file and try some basic math things out. Seach the [Julia Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/index.html) and learn how to print out strings and variables (you may find print, println, and display useful terms to search).
