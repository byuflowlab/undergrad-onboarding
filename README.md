# FLOW Lab Long Term Research Assistant (FlowLTRA) Program

This repository contains resources for onboarding undergraduate volunteers, 497R students, and paid Research Assistants.
The majority of the content is contained in the [ProjectDescriptions](ProjectDescriptions/) directory where [Level Zero Projects](ProjectDescriptions/Level0Projects) (introductory skills), [Level One Projects](ProjectDescriptions/Level1Projects) (volunteer skill development), and [Level Two Projects](ProjectDescriptions/Level2Projects) (497R projects) are outlined. Level Three and Four Projects also exist, but rather than the prescribed projects listed here, these are projects either supporting the research of a graduate student mentor (Level Three), or a research project leading towards a primary authorship on a conference/journal paper (Level Four). 

_Every_ student should start in the [Level Zero Projects](ProjectDescriptions/Level0Projects) to either orient themselves in basic auxiliary skills, or prove that they have profficiency therewith.

The end goal of these projects is to teach undergraduates the fundamental skills to be productive and effective researchers, ideally preparing them to be able to produce material fit for presenting at undergraduate research conferences, co-authoring research papers with graduate student mentors, and independently authoring their own peer reviewed research articles. A motivated freshman, starting out with Level Zero projects, can reasonably expect being well prepared for, working on, and potentially completing Level Four projects by the time they graduate. This does not preclude Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors from participating in FLOW Lab research, and in many cases, similar outcomes can be achieved for the motivated student.
