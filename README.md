# FLOW Lab Undergraduate Onboarding

This is an introductory mini-project (like a longer homework problem) designed to introduce you to some of the fundamental skills required to do research in the FLOW Lab.  A student with prior experience in programming and technical writing can likely complete this task in a couple weeks, whereas a freshmen may need a semester or two to learn some of these skills. 

The problem description is [here](leapfrog/leapfrog.pdf) and involves simulating vortex leapfrogging (you'll need to download the file to your computer for the links to work). A more detailed version by [Eduardo Alvarez](https://edoalvarezr.github.io/) is shown below.  Eduardo modeled the vortex leapfrogging phenomenon in order to help verify some of his analysis tools.

## Project Motivation

There are two main purposes for this starter project:

1. It provides an orientation to the bare minimum skills needed to begin participating as an undergraduate researcher in our lab.  While you could potentially learn these on the job, we find that a starter project provides several benefits: 1) the focus enables you to learn these basic skills much more quickly, 2) it allows both you and us to assess fit for research in the lab.

2. It allows those with less experience (e.g., freshmen) to start participating in our lab.  In the past we've asked students to wait until they've taken ME 273 and maybe ME 312, but with this route a motivated student can get a head start.
