# FLOW Lab Long Term Research Assistant (FlowLTRA) Program

The FlowLTRA program is being developed in order to aid the motivated undergraduate student in her/his efforts to develop skills related to performing research. This repository containts materials for three of five potential stages/levels of undergraduate research.  The zeroeth level is simply the [resources](0-resources) page. This page contains links to useful resources for other stages. The first level, [Activities](1-activities), is where intructional activities (analogous to homework assignments or pre-defined class projects) are described.  These activities have known solutions and are introductory in nature in that they require building necessary skills and understanding that can be applied to the second stage. The second level, [Projects](2-projects), are open ended in that there is not a "right" answer. These projects will require some planning and the path to complete them is not defined, and may not be immediately clear. The third and fourth levels of undergraduate research are working directly with graduate students on their research, and working on an independant research project, respectively. The motivated freshman starting out in the FlowLTRA program can reasonably expect to be working on level 3 and 4 projects by her/his senior year.  Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors can also expect significant outcomes and can enter at whatever level is appropriate for their abilities and interests.

Typically, the level one activities would be done on a volunteer basis, level two projects would be undertaken as 497R credit, and higher level projects would be paid research assistantships. These are not hard-set, however, and interested students should talk to graduate student mentors, and/or Dr. Ning when deciding on a research plan.

The general structure of the program is that the interested student would first look at the level two projects, and decide first if any of the projects are actually of interest. It is at this stage that s/he should communicate with graduate student mentors about projects s/he finds interesting. The end goal is for the student to work her/his way up to completing that level two project.  Each level two project description should include pre-requisite level one activities (which should reference level zero resources for required knowledge/skills) that should be completed if the student does not already possess the required knowledge and skills to do so.  If the student is already able to begin the level two project, there is no need to do unnecessary busy work. Everything a student does in the level one activities, or with content in the level zero resources should be building toward completing a level two (or higher) project.
