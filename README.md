# FLOW Lab Undergraduate Onboarding

This is an introductory mini-project (like a longer homework problem) designed to introduce you to some of the fundamental skills required to do research in the FLOW Lab.  A student with prior experience in programming and technical writing can likely complete this task in a couple weeks, whereas a freshmen may need a semester or two to learn some of these skills. 

The problem description is [here](leapfrog/leapfrog.pdf) (you'll need to download the file to your computer for the links to work).
