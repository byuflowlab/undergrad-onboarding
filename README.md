# FLOW Lab Undergraduate Onboarding

This is an introductory mini-project (like a longer homework problem) designed to introduce you to some of the fundamental skills required to do research in the FLOW Lab.  A student with prior experience in programming and technical writing can likely complete this task in a couple weeks, whereas a freshmen may need a semester or two to learn some of these skills. 

The problem description is [here](leapfrog/leapfrog.pdf) (you'll need to download the file to your computer for the links to work).

## Project Motivation:
Perhaps you're asking yourself, "Why this project? How is this useful?" Below is a simulation created by [Eduardo Alvarez](https://edoalvarezr.github.io/), as part of his research in the FLOW Lab. In his case, he modeled the vortex leapfrogging phenomenon in order to help verify some of the analysis tools he developed to help him in his research. In your case, you'll be able to verify your current, or soon-to-be-developed, skills in numerical methods and computational science, by putting together your own basic vortex leapfrogging simulation.  You'll also be able to develop and implement skills in research reading and writing (technical communications) as you put together a report as part of the project deliverables. 

As you work toward completing this introductory project, you'll first be able to get a taste of the flavor of research we do here in the FLOW Lab. You'll be able to decide if researching with us is something you really want to participate in.  You'll also develop the basic, bare minimum skills required to begin contributing as an undergraduate researcher. Thereby setting yourself up to be qualified for ME497R research credit, or possibly a paid research assistant position in the future.

Upon completion of this project, you should have created something to be proud of, call home about, and potentially include in a portfolio you can use for intership/job/grad school applications.
