# FLOW Lab Undergraduate Student Onboarding

This repository contains resources for onboarding undergraduate volunteers, 497R students, and paid Research Assistants.
The majority of the content is contained in the [ProjectDescriptions](ProjectDescriptions/) directory where [Level Zero Projects](ProjectDescriptions/Level0Projects) (introductory skills), [Level One Projects](ProjectDescriptions/Level1Projects) (volunteer skill development), and [Level Two Projects](ProjectDescriptions/Level2Projects) (497R projects) are outlined.

_Every_ student should start in the [Level Zero Projects](ProjectDescriptions/Level0Projects) to either orient themselves in basic auxiliary skills, or prove that they have profficiency therewith.

The end goal of these projects is to teach undergraduates the fundamental skills to be productive and effective researchers, ideally preparing them to be able to produce material fit for presenting at undergraduate research conferences, co-authoring research papers with graduate student mentors, and potentially independently authoring their own peer reviewed research articles.
