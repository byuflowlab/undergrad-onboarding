# Activities

These application activities are desgined to help students apply the [basic skills](../0-resources/README.md) needed to work on [projects](../2-projects/README.md) in the future.  Along with the deliverables listed in the descriptions below, each activity should include a memo/report written in LateX.  Unless otherwise stated, the Julia or Python language should be used (Julia if you are on an aircraft track, python if on a wind energy track), and version control (Git) should be used as you go.
