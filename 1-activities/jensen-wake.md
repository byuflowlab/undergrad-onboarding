Implement the [Jensen wake model](http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/55857682/ris_m_2411.pdf).  Develop it incrementally

1. Start with only a one-dimensional version.  Verify it against the published data.
2. Allow the wind to come from any direction.  Verify against ...
3. Add multiple turbines.  Use the [?]() wake interaction approach.  Verify ...
4. Compute power and [AEP]() for ? wind rose.

You can prototype in any programming language you are comfortable with, but the final version should be the Python programming language (see Python under resources) and should use version control (see git under resources).
