# Panel Code

Implement a basic 2D surface panel code using the Hess-Smith formulation.  A panel code is used to evaluate the inviscid aerodynamic forces and moments of an airfoil as a function of the geometry and angle of attack.

An overview of the theory is available [here](http://flowlab.groups.et.byu.net/me515/slides/9-panel.pdf), with more detail [here](http://adl.stanford.edu/aa210b/Lecture_Notes_files/Hess-Smith.pdf).

You can start with Matlab if you are comfortable with Matlab, but for the final version you should use Julia as the programming language (see Julia under resources) and use version control during your development (see Git under resources).

Verify your results.  [XFOIL](https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/) is a good way to do that (be sure to use the inviscid settings).

Validate your results.  There is a lot of wind tunnel data available for NACA 4-series airfoils.
