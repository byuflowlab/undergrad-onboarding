# Rotor Design Track

Learn how to analyze and design a rotor of your choice (a propeller, wind-turbine, or helicopter rotor). In this track you will learn the basics of blade-element momentum theory so that you can analyze a rotor of your choice. Then in conjunction with basic optimization techniques, you will design a rotor that does what you want.

## Track-Specific Expected Outcomes
- Be able to analyze a rotor
  - Understand Blade-Element Momentum (BEM) theory basics
    - Airfoil fundamentals
    - Analysis method of BEM
    - Assumptions of BEM
    - Basic results of BEM

- Design Optimization basics
  - Gradient-based optimizaion vs gradient-free optimization
  - Objective Function
  - Constraints
