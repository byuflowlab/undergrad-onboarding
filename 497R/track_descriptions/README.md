# ME EN 497R Track Descriptions

Note that all tracks follow the same framework:
1. Readings and Exam on topics related to the chose track
1. An exploratory Assignment based on the tested topics
1. A 3-stage Application Project

The links below lead to more detailed descriptions and expected outcomes for each of the design tracks.
