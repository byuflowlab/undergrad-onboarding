# Airfame Aerodynamic Design Track

The Airfame Aerodynamic Design Track focuses on the overall aerodyanmic performance and stability of a basic wing + tail configured aircraft.
Typically, students choose to design airframes that are sized appropriately for applications in DIY remote control (RC) aircraft, since you could theoretically build and fly an RC plane based on your design, especially if participating in the BYU Aeronautics club.

This track covers theory related to wing and tail aerodynamics, flight performance, and stability.  Students should expect application assignments to cover elements of both configuration and basic aerodyanmic shape optimization
