# Windfarm Design Track

The idea behind this track is to help students develop the skills to analyze and optimize a windfarm.

- Project 1
    - Code up the Jensen cosine model.

- Project 2
    - Analyze a given windfarm layout using their wake model and a simple rotor power model. Calculate the AEP for a given wind rose.

- Project 3
    - Optimize the windfarm layout.


or

- Project 3
    - Learn the BEM. Analyze the UAE 20kW wind turbine. Compare against experimental data.
