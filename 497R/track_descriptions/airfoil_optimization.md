# Airfoil Optimization Track

The idea behind this project is to allow students to delve more into 2D airfoil dynamics and optimize an airfoil.

- Project 1
    - XFoil assignment, as in rotor_design

- Project 2
    - Surrogate model, or further XFoil assignment

- Project 3
    - Airfoil optimization
