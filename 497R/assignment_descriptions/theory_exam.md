# Theory Exam Information

The exam will be open note (so you should take notes on the assigned readings).

The content of the test will cover your assigned readings with a focus on vocabulary,
assumptions for the various analysis methodologies,
as well as conceptual understanding of the underlying physics.
There will also be some, but not many, mathematical workout problems based on foundational equations and formulas in the readings.

You will be allowed to take the exam two times,
with at least a week between attempts.
You will not be able to see the test questions or answers between takes.
The higher of the two scores will be used for your grade.

For any questions that you missed,
you may get back 3/4 of the points by correctly and completely answering the associated question(s) in the [Theory Exploration]() assignment.

The structure of the test will be mostly short answer,
matching,
and true/false questions,
with a few multiple choice questions.

The exam is expected to take between 40 and 60 minutes,
with a time limit of 90 minutes
