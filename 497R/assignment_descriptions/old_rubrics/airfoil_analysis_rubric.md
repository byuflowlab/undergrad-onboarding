# Airfoil Analysis Assignment Rubric

Here is the breakdown for the points.  Note that the breakdown follows a tree diagram, so any sub-bullet is the breakdown of the parent bullet's point. For instance, the entire assignment is worth 60 points. The exploration part is worth 35 of the 60 points (58\% of the total score). Writing skill is worth 6 of those 35 points. And so on.

    - (12 points) Explores effect of angle of attack on lift, drag, and moment.
        - (9 points) Discusses major characteristics of airfoil polar.
            - (2 points) Talks about lift, drag, and moment
            - (1 points) Talks about how lift, drag, and moment are all just functions of alpha... $C_L(\alpha)$, $C_D(\alpha)$, and $C_M(\alpha)$. ... All of these values are inter-related to the angle of attack of the airfoil.

    - (4 points) Explores effect of Reynold's Number
        - (1 point) Includes a relevant figure.
        - (1 point) Talks about the Reynold's number.
        - (2 point) Discusses the relationship between the Reynold's number and lift (drag and moment optional).

    - (4 points) Explores effect of airfoil thickness
        - (1 point) Includes a relevant figure.
        - (1 point) Explains thickness
