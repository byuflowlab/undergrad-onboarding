        - (4 points) Student demonstrates a good design process.
        - (4 points) Student clearly communicates improved design.
        - (4 points) Student clearly demonstrates why design is improved.
        - (4 points) Student's design obeys constraints.



- (20 points) Research Skills
    - (15 points) Previous skills
        - (1 point) Preamble comments are present.
        - (1 points) Comments are correct.
        - (1 point) Comments are pretty and concise.
        - (1 point) Used a branch.
        - (1 point) Used issues properly.
        - (1 point) Used a pull request.
        - (1 point) Code was submitted.
        - (3 points) Functions
            - (1 point) Functions are used.
            - (1 point) Function names are useful. Functions have docstrings.

            - (1 point) Code is well organized.

    - (5 points) Runfile
        - (2 points) A single run file to run experiments, and generate plots.
        - (1 points) Functions are included in other files.
        - (2 points) Code is well organized.
