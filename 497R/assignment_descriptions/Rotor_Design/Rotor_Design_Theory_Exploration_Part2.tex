\section{Exploration}
\label{sec:exploration}

Complete the following exploration.

\subsection{Prerequisites}
\label{ssec:prereqs}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
	\item \href{https://flow.byu.edu/CCBlade.jl/stable/}{Install CCBlade.jl}
	\item Complete the \href{https://flow.byu.edu/CCBlade.jl/stable/tutorial/}{Quick Start Tutorial}
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Load Distributions and Rotor Efficiency}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
	\item Compare the thrust, torque, and root bending moment vs varying rotor tip radius.
	\item Compare the thrust, torque, and root bending moment vs varying the rotor section chord length.
	\item Discuss your results and make especial note of cases that are physically unfeasible, or not fully captured by the BEMT.
\end{enumerate}
