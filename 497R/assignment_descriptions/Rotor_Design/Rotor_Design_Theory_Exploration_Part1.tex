\section{Exploration}
\label{sec:exploration}

Complete the following exploration.

\subsection{Prerequisites}
\label{ssec:prereqs}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
	\item \href{https://flow.byu.edu/Xfoil.jl/stable/#Installation}{Install Xfoil.jl} and complete the \href{https://flow.byu.edu/Xfoil.jl/stable/guide/}{Example Usage Guide}.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Forces, Moments, and Polars}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
	\item Create the following plots using the example airfoil from the previous problem:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Lift vs Angle of Attack
		\item Induced Drag (near and far field) vs Angle of Attack
		\item Moment vs Angle of Attack
		\item Lift vs Drag
		\item Lift/Drag vs Angle of Attack
	\end{itemize}
	\item Identify the lift curve slope in your lift vs angle of attack plot, and compare it to the lift curve slope from thin airfoil theory (\(2\pi\)).
\end{enumerate}
