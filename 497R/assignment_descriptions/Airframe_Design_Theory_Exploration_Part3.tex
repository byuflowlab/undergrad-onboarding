\section{Exploration}
\label{sec:exploration}

Complete the following exploration.

\subsection{Prerequisites}
\label{ssec:prereqs}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
	\item Obtain, and become familiar with, the following tools auxiliary to VortexLattice.jl including:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The eigen value code
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Stability}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
	\item Explore how the Vertical and Horizontal Tail Volume Ratios affect the static and dynamic stability of an airframe.
	\item Explore how wing sweep and dihedral affect the static and dynamic stability of an airframe.
	\item In preparation for you next assignments, use what you found in the previous to steps to create an airframe (wing + tail) design that is stable.
\end{enumerate}
