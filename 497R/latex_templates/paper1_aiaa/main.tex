\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

% A lot of your initial method details will probably come from content in your theory exploration assignment.  Feel free to copy and paste from that assignment as needed.

% Example of how to format your optimization problem in an equation format
\begin{equation} %using the equation environment will add a number and allow you to reference it.
\label{eqn:optimization_problem} %use this label to reference this equation
	\begin{aligned}
		\mathrm{minimize:~~} & (objective) \\ %Put your objective function here (minimize or maximize)
		\mathrm{with~respect~to:~~} & (design~variables) \\ % list out your design variables here
		\mathrm{such~that:~~} & (constraint1) \\ % constraints are usually < > =, ect.,
					   & (constraint2) \\ % so it helps to put them on multiple lines
					   %... etc.
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
