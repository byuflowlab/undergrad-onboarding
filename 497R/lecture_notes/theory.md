# Theory.md

A flipped classroom model on the theory. We could sell this as a test review. There is a lot of theory that should be applicable across the board. 

Concepts:
___
- Non-dimensional numbers
  - What they are
  - Why we use them
  - What some common ones are
  - What the difference is between common ones

- Geometry
  - Chord, span, radius, twist, angle of attack, camber, airfoil thickness

- Common assumptions and what they mean
  - Inviscid
  - Steady
  - Irrotational

- Common approaches
  - Conservation laws

- Common math? (Some of this would be a practical review, some would be for better understanding the theory)
  - Integration
    - 1D, 2D, 3D
    - Line integral
    - Loop integral
  - Derivative
    - derivative
    - partial derivative
    - Total derivative
    - gradient
    - Laplacian
  - Numerical Approximation
  - Green's Theorem
  - Linear Algebra
    - dot product, matrix math, cross product
