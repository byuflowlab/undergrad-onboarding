# Experimental Airfoils Track

The idea of this set of projects is to give the student a chance to not only analyze airfoils, but compare against experimental data that they collect. 


- Paper 1
    - Learn XFoil. Analyze an airfoil. Basically the same as the xfoil assignment in the rotor design track. 

- Paper 2
    - Collect data on an airfoil in the wind tunnel. Treat the data. Run statistics on the data. Compare against XFoil. 

- Paper 3
    - Possibly no paper 3.
