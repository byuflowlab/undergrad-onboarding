# ME EN 497R FLOW Lab

## Overview
ME EN 497R is a research course that may be applied toward the technical elective requirement for the Mechanical Engineering program (and occasionally other programs, e.g. Applied Physics).
The overall goal of the 497R course is to give undergraduates research experiences typically reserved for graduate students, albeit in an format accessible to the abilities and time constraints of an undergraduate student.
In the FLOW Lab, under the direction of Dr. Ning, we have somewhat formalized this course while also allowing a great deal of student-lead learning.
497R is a challenging course that requires self-motivation and we have high expectations of the students who choose to take this course.

## Prequisites

 - The Julia language, including using packages, functions, loops, doctstrings, comments, etc.
 - LaTeX, including basic document creation, section headers, including figures, etc.
 - Creating a github repository and using git for basic add, commit, pull, and push commands.

## Project Tracks

ME EN 497R can take multiple tracks depending on student interests.  Currently, we have 2 major tracks available: Airframe Design, and Rotor Design.  You can find descriptions of these tracks [here](./track_descriptions)
