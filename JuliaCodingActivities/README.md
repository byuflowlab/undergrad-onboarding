# Julia Beginner Coding Activities/Tutorials

First things first. You need to get Julia. You can get the current version from [https://julialang.org/](https://julialang.org/). Once you've got it downloaded, you're ready to go (see this [getting started page](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia/Getting_started)).  You'll be able to run julia directly from the command line via the Julia [REPL](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia/The_REPL), but you may (most definitely will) find that you want to use some kind of text editor. Choosing a text editor is a personal choice, but the supported one for Julia is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with the [Julia extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julialang.language-julia)).

For the following tutorials, we will primarily be using the [Julia Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) and [Introducing Julia](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia). Some other quick references for Julia syntax are [Learn X in Y, where X=Julia](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/), and [Julia by Example](https://juliabyexample.helpmanual.io/).

If you would like a crash-course in Julia, you may consider [this YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQ2JMBcfAsi_3g2AFJ6B84d8c5jw5kXp) or [this free course](https://juliaacademy.com/p/julia-programming-for-nervous-beginners).

If you would like some more advanced exercises in Julia, you may look at [some of these](https://exercism.org/tracks/julia/exercises).

In addition, there is a [free MIT course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-s191-introduction-to-computational-thinking-fall-2020/pages/syllabus/) on julia that may be of interest to those looking for an in depth understanding of how to use Julia in practical numerical methods.

As a bare minimum introduction to the Julia language, we are going to do some basic airfoil generation and plotting.
<!-- , very similar to a homework problem from the aerodynamics class, ME EN 515. The activities here will help you develop the necessary skills to complete your own [Panel Method](latex/panelmethod.pdf). -->

(Note: The activities are .pdf files that can be downloaded so you don't have to be online to access them. Also note that the hyperlinks do _not_ work in the github preview, so you will need to download them if you want the hyper links to function properly.)
