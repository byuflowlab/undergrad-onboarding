# Wind Farm Layout Optimization

## Effects of Different Wake Models on Optimization

Wake models are used to predict how fast wind is moving behind a wind turbine. There are many different wake models, ranging in complexity and accuracy. How does your choice of wake model affect your wind farm design? If you design a wind farm using one wake model, is that same design still optimal if you analyze it with a different model?

## Effects of Different Wind Farm Boundaries on Optimization

## Effects of Different Metrics on Optimization

Often wind farm layouts are optimized for maximum energy production. However, there may be other important metrics. How does a wind farm layout change if it is designed to reduce variance instead of maximize mean power? What if you consider costs or structural loads?

## Effects of Different Constraints on Optimization

## Coupled Layout and Turbine Design

Usually, when designing a wind farm you decide on some turbine design and use that throughout your study. What if you designed the wind turbine at the same time as the wind farm layout? What if you designed a wind farm with different wind turbines, rather than assuming they are all the same?

## Improved Computation Strategies

Wind farm analysis is often very time consuming. There are a lot of calculations that need to be made to model how each turbine interacts with the rest of the turbines in a wind farm. In an optimization, a wind farm needs to be analyzed hundereds or thousands of times! Can you speed up wind farm analysis using code optimization, parallelization, or some other method?

## Performance of Different Optimization Algorithms

In the FLOW lab, we almost exclusively use a gradient-based optimizer called SNOPT. This is a good optimizer that has provided good results. However, there very well may be a different optimizer that provides better, faster solutions.
