# Wind Farm Layout Optimization

## Effects of Different Wake Models on Optimization

Wake models are used to predict how fast wind is moving behind a wind turbine. There are many different wake models, ranging in complexity and accuracy. How does your choice of wake model affect your wind farm design? If you design a wind farm using one wake model, is that same design still optimal if you analyze it with a different model?

## Coupled Layout and Turbine Design

Usually, when designing a wind farm you decide on some turbine design and use that throughout your study. What if you designed the wind turbine at the same time as the wind farm layout? What if you designed a wind farm with different wind turbines, rather than assuming they are all the same?
