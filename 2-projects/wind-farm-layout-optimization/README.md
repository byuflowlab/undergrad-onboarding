## Effects of Different Wake Models on Optimization

Wake models are used to predict how fast wind is moving behind a wind turbine. There are many different wake models, ranging in complexity and accuracy. How does your choice of wake model affect your wind farm design? If I design a wind farm using one wake model, is that same design still optimal if I analyze it with a different model?
