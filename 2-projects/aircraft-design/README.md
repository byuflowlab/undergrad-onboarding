# Aircraft Design

## Configurations

The best aircraft configuration is often mission-dependent.  Find the impact of specific configuration choices on the design of transport aircraft, high altitude drones, small unmanned aerial vehicles and/or flying cars.

## Model Development

Aircraft design includes several sub-disciplines including aerodynamics, structures, and dynamics.  Choose an area of focus within one of these sub-disciplines and develop and/or implement a new model to increase the lab's analysis capabilities.  Evaluate the new model's speed, precision, and accuracy.  If you're interested in the aerodynamics sub-discipline you may want to check out some of the projects listed in the [aerodynamics](../aerodynamics) section.

## Model Fidelity

There is often a trade-off between model fidelity and required computational resources.  Increase the speed and/or accuracy of an existing model in the lab.  Explore the assumptions that must be made for your model and ways to increase the applicability of your model.

## Objective/Constraints

Optimal aircraft designs are highly dependent on the objectives and constraints placed on the design.  Explore the impact of various objectives and constraints on aircraft design.  How does the design change as more realistic objectives and constraints are added.  How sensitive is your design to various objectives and constraints.

## Surrogate Models

Develop a surrogate model.
