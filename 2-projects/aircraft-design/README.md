# Aircraft Design

## Configurations

The best aircraft configuration is often mission-dependent.  Find the impact of specific configuration choices on the design of transport aircraft, high altitude drones, small unmanned aerial vehicles and/or flying cars.

## Model Development

Aircraft design includes several sub-disciplines including aerodynamics, structures, and dynamics.  Choose an area of focus within one of these sub-disciplines and develop and/or implement a new model to increase the lab's analysis capabilities.  Evaluate the new model's speed, precision, and accuracy.  If you're interested in the aerodynamics sub-discipline you may want to check out some of the projects listed in the [aerodynamics](../aerodynamics) section.

How does changing model fidelity

## Objective 

As you add more realistic objectives how does aircraft design change. 

## Surrogate Models

Develop surrogate model
