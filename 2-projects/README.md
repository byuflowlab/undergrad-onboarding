# Projects

The following projects are primarily for students registered for 497R (research) class credit with Dr. Ning.  The purpose of these projects is to allow students to explore a subject area relevant to research in the FLOW Lab.  These projects are designed to be open ended (there is not a single answer), but have a clear final objective and path to completion.  

## Technical Requirements

These projects are designed to draw on skills gained from completing a selection of [Activities](../Activities) (also found in this repo).  Each project definition explicitly lists the [Activities](../Activities) which develop the necessary skills to start these projects.
