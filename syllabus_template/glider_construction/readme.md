# Glider Construction


The idea of this track is to give the student basic airplane analysis tools and help them construct a glider. The glider could be something like a discus launch glider, or maximizing L/D. It might be fun to do something that can do loops. 

- Project 1
    - Learn XFLR5 project. Create and analyze a previously designed plane. 

- Project 2
    - Design your own glider in XFLR (no motor, controls optional)

- Project 3
    - Build the glider.
