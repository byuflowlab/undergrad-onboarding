# Panel Method Assignment - Rubric

Here is the breakdown for the points.  Note that the breakdown follows a tree diagram, so any sub-bullet is the breakdown of the parent bullet's point. For instance, the entire assignment is worth 60 points. The exploration part is worth 35 of the 60 points (58\% of the total score). Writing skill is worth 6 of those 35 points. And so on.
