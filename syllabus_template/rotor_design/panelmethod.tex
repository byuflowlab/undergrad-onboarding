	\section{Background}
	
	Airfoils are the cross sections of wings and rotors, so airfoil performance directly affects the performance of any lifting object.
	A simple way to analyze airfoils is by using a \textit{panel method}. 
	Learn more about the theory from the ME 515 Book and/or a google search.
	
	For this assignment, you will be utilizing a code produced by students in the FLOWLab called Xfoil.jl.
	Go through the examples in the documentation to get familiar with how to use the code.
	
	
	\section{Assignment}
	Once you are familiar with using Xfoil.jl, complete the following:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Define words and include them in an appendix dictionary.  Include images to illustrate meaning where applicable. 
		\item Explore the effect of airfoil angle of attack on airfoil lift, drag, and moment.
		\item Compare data collected from XFoil to published data (experimental or other). 
		\item Explore the effect of airfoil thickness and camber on airfoil lift, drag., and moment.
		\item Explore the effect of Reynolds number on airfoil lift, drag, and moment.
		\item Write a report (paper) on your methods, results, and takeaways as described in the course syllabus.
		\item Submit your code via a branch/pull request as described in the course syllabus.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\bigskip
	
	Here are some words of use that you may want to include in your appendix dictionary:
	
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Coefficient of Drag, $C_D$
    \item Coefficient of Lift, $C_L$
    \item Coefficient of Moment, $C_M$
    \item Angle of Attack, $\alpha$
    \item Airfoil Polar
    \item Stall
    \item Chord, $c$
    \item Camber
    \item Airfoil Thickness
    \item Freestream Velocity, $V_\infty$
    \item Reynolds Number, $Re$
    \item Mach Number, $M$
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
